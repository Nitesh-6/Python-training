1. [] - (character class) Theyâ€™re used for specifying a character class,

        ex := 
        ex1) [abc] will match any of the characters 'a','b', or 'c' 
        ex2) [a-c] is same but uses a range to represent set of characters to match 
        ex3) [a-z] from any of the characters from 'a' to 'z'
        ex4) [1-99] for any of 1 to 99
        ex5) [a-zA-Z0-9_] matches any alphanumeric character
